## Welcome to Cadence Pro

Cadence Pro is an app designed to let you set the beats per minute aka the tempo of your Apple Music library on iOS. This allows you to sync your your steps aka cadence to the beat of your music library! Enjoy your music at heart racing speeds or use it to improve your running cadence. You can even use Cadence Pro to slow you music down!

### Why Cadence Pro

When I first started running, I quickly learned that cadence was important because the faster your cadence is, the less impact you have on each stride and thus the less likely you are to suffer an injury. With that in mind I tried to find an app that could do what Cadence Pro can do - play my own music library from Apple Music to whatever speed I wanted. After a long search, nothing quite fit the bill and being a software developer, I decided to make the app that I wanted to use.
